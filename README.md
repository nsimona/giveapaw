## Introduction

Give A Paw is a full-stack application designed to facilitate pet adoption. Its standout feature is a sophisticated recommendation engine that leverages content-based filtering algorithms. This engine connects users and pets, providing personalized recommendations for the best matches.

## Architecture

The project adopts a microservices architecture with event-driven patterns. Four services - `auth`, `pets`, `applications`, and `recommendations` - communicate via NATS messaging. These services share common logic through the `common` module, an npm package containing abstract shared functionalities. The services, built using TypeScript, Node.js, Express, Redis, and MongoDB, can evolve independently and use TDD principles.

## Back-end development

### Auth Service

- Responsible for user authentication and authorization. TODO

### Pets Service

- Manages pet-related operations, including listing and details. TODO

### Applications Service

- Handles pet adoption applications and approvals. TODO

### Recommendations Service

- Employs content-based filtering to generate personalized pet recommendations.

### Common Module Logic

- Abstract shared logic for common functionalities among services.

## Front-end development

The client, available in the `client` branch, utilizes React, Axios, React Router, Material UI, and Redux for state management. The UI/UX design incorporates custom elements to enhance user experience.

## Recommendation Engine

The heart of Give A Paw's intelligence lies in the recommendation engine. By analyzing user preferences and pet characteristics, it provides personalized suggestions for potential matches.

## Infrastructure

The microservices communicate via NATS, ensuring efficient event-driven communication. Redis and MongoDB store data, contributing to a scalable and resilient infrastructure.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js
- npm
- Kubernetes
- Docker
- Skaffold

## Running the Application

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project root.
   TODO

## Tests

The project initially followed a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach. However, recent changes lack unit tests, causing some failures. Contributions to address this are welcome.

## Deployment

Follow deployment guidelines in the respective service directories. Ensure proper environment configurations for production.

## Thank you!

Thank you for your interest in making Give A Paw a successful pet adoption platform! Although it will propbably not be used from real users, mostly for learning and exeprimenting üêæ
